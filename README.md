# Vrinda_Sales_Reports_Excel_Project
Excel end to end project
Excited to share my latest project using Microsoft Excel as a part of my mini project as a Data Analyst, where I performed veranda store data! 💼💥 Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, I crafted insightful visualizations shedding light on various aspects of the report. Here's a glimpse into what I've accomplished:

Pie charts: Analyzed success rates by type of Orders and Sales, Channel type, and type of Sellers, a clear understanding of patterns and trends.

📊 Clustered bar chart: Mapped success rates by region, enabling nuanced comparisons and regional insights.

Tracked the count of incidents over the years, providing a historical perspective on Orders occurrences.

💡 Leveraging slicers for country and year of channels, I empowered users to dynamically interact with the data, enhancing their exploration and analysis experience.

🔍 This project not only honed my Excel skills but also deepened my understanding of complex datasets and their real-world implications. Excited to continue exploring the intersection of data and insights in future.
